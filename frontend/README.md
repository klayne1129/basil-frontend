### Overview
Recipe website/Database

Everyone who cooks hates trying to find recipes that are embedded inside 10-page blog posts. My program will allow users to create / edit their recipes and store them online for later use. Users can search for their desired recipe using either the title of the recipe, an ingredient, categorey, or tags (“vegetarian”, “dinner”). Recipes can be updated by users at any time to add notes (e.g., can use honey as a substitute for sugar), adjust the recipe itself (e.g., change ½ tsp of salt to 2 tsp of salt), or add an image to the recipe. If a user wants a physical copy of their recipe, they will have the option to print. This program eliminates the frustration and time wasting that comes with hunting for recipes online and allows busy cooks to get back to what really matters, cooking.

### Features
